# A quick setup for a discord bot

Note: This will only work for discord.js!

## Setup

Firstly, make sure you have downloaded [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Then, use git to clone this repository. This will generate a new directory called Quick-Discord-Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phatfox2/Quick-Discord-Setup.git
```
Enter the directory and then use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install discord.js. Don't worry about installing npm; it comes with node. Also, if you get some warns from doing this, just ignore them.
```bash
cd Quick-Discord-Setup
npm install discord.js --save
```
Now, if you haven't already, make the [discord bot application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) on the [discord homepage](discord.com)
